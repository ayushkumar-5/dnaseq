# **App Name**: DNASEQ

## Core Features:

- Sequence Input: Input field for DNA sequences (accepts FASTA format).
- Sequence Display: Display the DNA sequence to the user, using a monospaced font. Sequence must be displayed such that the user can easily select, copy and paste into another document.
- Nucleotide Analyzer: Analyze the sequence, identifying all nucleotide bases.
- Tallying Algorithm: Tally the total count of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) in the given sequence.
- Results Display: Display results, i.e. frequency/count of each nucleotide.
- AI Warning Generator Tool: If any warnings should be issued to the user, such as a non-DNA character appearing in the sequence, generate that warning using AI, and decide whether it needs to be shown.
- Warning Display: Display warnings when DNA anomalies are encountered.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium purple (#9370DB) to reflect precision and biological accuracy.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) for a clean and analytical feel.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D8B4FE) for interactive elements and calls to action, providing a subtle yet distinct contrast.
- Use clear, monospaced fonts for displaying the code and related results
- Clean and structured layout, emphasizing data visualization and easy navigation.
- Subtle transitions on analysis completion and results display.
