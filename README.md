DNASEQ - Nucleotide Frequency Analyzer
DNASEQ is a web-based DNA sequence analysis tool that allows users to input DNA sequences in FASTA format and receive detailed information, statistics, and visualizations about the nucleotide composition and properties of the sequence.

ðŸŒŸ Features
âœ… FASTA Format Support
Accepts sequences with headers (lines starting with > will be ignored).

ðŸ”¬ Nucleotide Frequency Analysis
Counts and calculates the percentage of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) in the sequence.

ðŸ§¬ Sequence Properties

Total sequence length

GC content

Estimated melting temperature (Tm)

Reverse complement of the sequence

ðŸ“Š Interactive Visualizations

Bar chart of nucleotide distribution

Full nucleotide count table
